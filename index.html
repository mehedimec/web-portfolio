        <h3>World Class Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Md. Mehedi Hasan, and I'm a web developer. I've always been a creative person who loves to bring ideas to life. This is very much the reason why I chose web development as my profession. The continous learning in an ever-growing industry is something I love being a part of. There's always something new and interesting to learn about. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.</p>
